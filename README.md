## How this game looks like

Well, pretty much what you just saw in the trailer. (You watched it, didn't you? Here is a second chance: [trailer](https://youtu.be/owDAcE-v2d4) 🎬)

When you launch the game, what you will see first is:

You can select scenes (worlds):

And then select levels to play:

To pass a level, you need to go through two stages (modes):

**Deploy**, where you place tools provided from the toolbox so that you can build a route for Max and Duke. You are supposed to make the cost of tools you used as less as possible:

And **Play**, where you can control Max and Duke to go to the destination:

When you are in **Play** stage, you fail if you fall:

There are more than one solution for each level. Some of them are optimal and you can get three stars for them. Try to get all level three-starred!

Hope you like **Max and Duke**!
